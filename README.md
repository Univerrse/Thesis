# Thesis
All of the code for my Master Thesis.
Model 1 is a basic GMM Model.
Model 2 is a GMM model with RE(Random Effects).
Model 3 is a GMM model with AR(Autoregressive components).
Model 4 is a GMM model wiht AR+RE, which is the most complex model.
The file with Model_1_troublemaker_entropy is the one on which I am experimenting with new code and this is how I approach the troublemaker case.
